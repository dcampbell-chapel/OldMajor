            "Has there been any political group challenging those in power that hasn't been attacked and called \"communistic\"? No.",
            "Two things are clear from this: All European powers already recognize Communism as a powerful force.",
            "It’s time for Communists to openly declare their beliefs, goals, and intentions to the entire world.",
            "They must answer this \"ghost story\" of the Spectre of Communism with an official statement—a manifesto—from the party itself.",
            "For this reason, Communists from many different countries have met in London and written the following manifesto.",
            "The history of every society that has ever existed is a history of class struggles.",
            "Free citizens against slaves, Wealthy nobles against common citizens, Lords against serfs, Guild-masters against journeymen,",
            "In every age, it has been the oppressor versus the oppressed.",
            "They were always in constant conflict, fighting a never-ending battle that was sometimes hidden and sometimes open.",
            "This fight always ended in one of two ways: A complete, revolutionary change of society or the total ruin of both sides.",
            "Our current era, the age of the bourgeoisie (the ruling, property-owning class), has one key difference: it has simplified the struggle between classes.",
            "Society is increasingly splitting into two main hostile groups, two great classes directly facing each other: the Bourgeoisie (the rich owners) and the Proletariat (the working class).",
            "The modern Bourgeoisie is not ancient; it is the result of a long process of change and a series of revolutions in how goods are produced and traded.",
            "With every step of the Bourgeoisie's growth, they gained more political power.",
            "Once oppressed by the feudal nobility, the Bourgeoisie finally, after creating modern industry and a global market, took over complete political control in the modern representative government.",
            "The government today is nothing more than a committee for managing the collective business of the whole Bourgeoisie.",
            "Historically, the Bourgeoisie has played a truly revolutionary role.",
            "Wherever they have taken control, they have destroyed all the old, traditional ways of life—the feudal, family-based, and peaceful-seeming relationships.",
            "They have mercilessly ripped apart the diverse feudal ties that connected people to their \"natural superiors.\"",
            "Now, the only connection left between people is naked self-interest and cold, hard \"cash payment.\"",
            "The Bourgeoisie has drowned the most passionate feelings—religious excitement, knightly honor, sentimental pity—in the icy water of selfish calculation.",
            "It has reduced a person's value to a simple exchange price (how much their labor is worth), and in place of countless sacred, guaranteed freedoms, it has established just one unethical freedom—Free Trade.",
            "In a word, for exploitation that was once hidden by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.",
            "The Bourgeoisie has stripped the honor from every job that was once respected and looked upon with admiration.",
            "It has turned the doctor, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, and the scientist into its paid wage-laborers.",
            "The Bourgeoisie cannot survive without constantly revolutionizing the tools of production, and with them, all of society's relationships.",
            "Constant revolutionizing of production.",
            "Uninterrupted disruption of all social conditions.",
            "Everlasting uncertainty and constant activity.",
            "These things set the bourgeois era apart from all others.",
            "All fixed, old relationships, along with their long history of accepted prejudices, are swept away.",
            "All new relationships become outdated before they can even become permanent.",
            "\"All that is solid melts into air,\" and humanity is finally forced to face the real conditions of its life and its relationship with others.",
            "The need for a constantly expanding market chases the Bourgeoisie all over the world.",
            "They must settle everywhere, connect everywhere, and establish connections everywhere.",
            "The low prices of their goods are like heavy artillery used to knock down any defense, including the strong resistance of foreigners to change.",
            "They force all nations, on pain of being destroyed, to adopt the bourgeois way of production; they compel them to introduce what they call \"civilization\"—which really means to become bourgeois themselves.",
            "In a single word: they are creating a world in their own image.",
            "During its short rule of less than a hundred years, the Bourgeoisie has created more massive and colossal productive power than all previous generations combined.",
            "However, modern bourgeois society is like a sorcerer who has lost control of the powerful forces he conjured up with his spells.",
            "For many decades, the history of industry has been a history of the powerful, modern ways of producing things rebelling against the current conditions of production—the very property laws that the Bourgeoisie needs to exist and rule.",
            "The commercial crises (economic depressions) that happen periodically prove this.",
            "Each time they return, they threaten the existence of all bourgeois society.",
            "It is now clear that the Bourgeoisie is no longer fit to be the ruling class in society.",
            "They are unfit to rule because they are unable to guarantee a living for their own workers, their \"slaves.\"",
            "They cannot prevent their workers from sinking into such poverty that the Bourgeoisie must feed them, instead of being fed by their work.",
            "Society can no longer live under the Bourgeoisie's rule.",
            "The essential condition for the existence of the bourgeois class is the creation and growth of capital (wealth); the condition for capital is wage-labor.",
            "Wage-labor relies exclusively on the competition between workers.",
            "But the growth of industry, which the Bourgeoisie unknowingly promotes, is replacing the workers' isolation (due to competition) with a revolutionary alliance (due to working together).",
            "Therefore, the development of Modern Industry is destroying the very foundation on which the Bourgeoisie produces wealth.",
            "What the Bourgeoisie produces, above all else, are its own grave-diggers.",
            "Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."
